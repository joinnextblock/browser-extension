# NextBlock Billboard - Low-Level Design Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as the main index for all low-level design documents (LDDs) for the NextBlock Billboard browser extension. These documents provide detailed technical specifications for each component of the system as outlined in the high-level design document.

## Document Structure

Each low-level design document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - Component purpose and responsibilities
2. **Dependencies** - External modules and APIs required
3. **Data Structures** - Key data structures and interfaces
4. **Component Interface** - Public methods and APIs
5. **Implementation Details** - Specific implementation guidance
6. **Process Flow Diagrams** - Visual representation of key processes
7. **Integration Points** - How the component interacts with others
8. **Testing Considerations** - Guidelines for testing
9. **Security Considerations** - Security-related implementation details
10. **Future Enhancements** - Potential improvements

## Low-Level Design Documents

### 1. [Account Management Module](NextBlock-Billboard-Account-Management-LDD.md)
Handles user account operations including key generation, storage, and management.

**Key Features:**
- Nostr key pair generation and import
- Secure storage of private keys
- User profile management
- Account switching

### 2. [Relay Connection Module](NextBlock-Billboard-Relay-Connection-LDD.md)
Manages connections to Nostr relays with focus on NextBlock relay and NIP-42 authentication.

**Key Features:**
- WebSocket connection management
- NIP-42 authentication implementation
- Subscription handling
- Message parsing and routing

### 3. [NIP-07 Provider Module](NextBlock-Billboard-NIP07-Provider-LDD.md)
Implements the Nostr protocol's NIP-07 specification for web page integration.

**Key Features:**
- window.nostr interface implementation
- Event signing capabilities
- Public key access
- NIP-04 encryption/decryption

### 4. [Event Processing Module](NextBlock-Billboard-Event-Processing-LDD.md)
Handles the processing, filtering, and management of Nostr events.

**Key Features:**
- Bitcoin-tagged event filtering
- Kind 99999 event handling
- Event metadata enrichment
- Caching and optimization

### 5. [UI Component Module](NextBlock-Billboard-UI-Component-LDD.md)
Implements the user interface for the extension popup.

**Key Features:**
- Account management interface
- Bitcoin event display
- Kind 99999 event display
- Connection status visualization

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these components, developers should adhere to the following principles:

1. **Modularity** - Each component should be implemented as an independent module with clearly defined interfaces
2. **Security** - Follow security best practices, especially for handling private keys
3. **Error Handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages
4. **Performance** - Optimize for performance, especially for background operations
5. **Testing** - Write comprehensive tests for each component
6. **Documentation** - Document all public interfaces and complex functionality

## Development Workflow

The recommended development workflow is:

1. Implement the Account Management module first
2. Then implement the Relay Connection module
3. Followed by the Event Processing module
4. Implement the UI Component module
5. Finally, implement the NIP-07 Provider module

This sequence allows for incremental testing and integration.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build System**: Webpack
- **Extension Framework**: Browser Extension Manifest V3
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Storage**: Browser Extension Storage API
- **Networking**: WebSocket API

## Conclusion

These low-level design documents provide a comprehensive blueprint for implementing the NextBlock Billboard extension. By following these specifications, developers can build a consistent, maintainable, and secure extension that fulfills all the requirements outlined in the high-level design.
